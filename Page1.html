    <h2>Glossary (Page 1 of 3)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Assets:</strong> Assets are resources with economic value that individuals or organizations own or control. These include cash, investments, real estate, and equipment. Assets are expected to provide future benefits and are used to assess financial stability. They are essential in calculating net worth and forming the foundation of a balance sheet.</li>
      <li><strong>Liabilities:</strong> Liabilities represent financial obligations or debts owed by an individual or business. Examples include loans, credit card balances, and accounts payable. Liabilities reduce net worth and are vital when calculating overall financial health. They're classified as current (short-term) or non-current (long-term) on balance sheets to assess risk and solvency.</li>
      <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Equity is the residual interest in assets after deducting liabilities. In personal finance, it's the value of an owned asset minus any debt on it, like home equity. In business, it's shareholders’ ownership stake, representing company value after debts. Positive equity indicates financial strength and investment potential.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash Flow:</strong> Cash flow is the movement of money into and out of a business or personal account. Positive cash flow means incoming funds exceed outgoings, supporting operations and growth. It’s crucial for budgeting, planning, and ensuring bills and investments can be met without additional borrowing.</li>
      <li><strong>Net Worth:</strong> Net worth equals total assets minus total liabilities. For individuals, it represents financial health and stability. For businesses, it shows solvency and performance. Positive net worth means assets exceed debts. Tracking net worth over time helps measure financial progress and supports better decision-making.</li>
      <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> A credit score is a number ranging from 300 to 850 that indicates a person’s creditworthiness. It's based on payment history, credit utilization, and account age. Higher scores mean lower lending risk, influencing loan approvals, interest rates, and financial trust from banks and creditors.</li>
      <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money, usually expressed as a percentage. It determines how much extra you'll pay on loans or earn on savings. Rates vary based on credit risk, loan type, and economic conditions, and they influence investment and borrowing decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR):</strong> APR represents the annual cost of borrowing, including interest and fees. It helps compare different loan offers. A lower APR means a cheaper loan over time. It's more accurate than just looking at interest rates alone, especially for credit cards, mortgages, and personal loans.</li>
      <li><strong>Annual Percentage Yield (APY):</strong> APY is the annual return on an investment or savings account, factoring in compound interest. It reflects the real rate of earnings over a year, making it useful for comparing deposit accounts. A higher APY means more interest earned, assuming no withdrawals occur.</li>
      <li><strong>Budget:</strong> A budget is a financial plan outlining expected income and expenses over a specific period. It helps manage spending, save money, and achieve goals. Budgets can be personal or business-focused and ensure financial discipline by tracking where money goes and controlling overspending habits.</li>
