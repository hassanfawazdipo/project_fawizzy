    <ul>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Assets:</strong> Assets are resources with economic value that individuals or organizations own or control. These include cash, investments, real estate, and equipment. Assets are expected to provide future benefits and are used to assess financial stability. They are essential in calculating net worth and forming the foundation of a balance sheet.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Liabilities:</strong> Liabilities represent financial obligations or debts owed by an individual or business. Examples include loans, credit card balances, and accounts payable. Liabilities reduce net worth and are vital when calculating overall financial health. They're classified as current (short-term) or non-current (long-term) on balance sheets to assess risk and solvency.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Equity:</strong> Equity is the residual interest in assets after deducting liabilities. In personal finance, it's the value of an owned asset minus any debt on it, like home equity. In business, it's shareholders’ ownership stake, representing company value after debts. Positive equity indicates financial strength and investment potential.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Cash Flow:</strong> Cash flow is the movement of money into and out of a business or personal account. Positive cash flow means incoming funds exceed outgoings, supporting operations and growth. It’s crucial for budgeting, planning, and ensuring bills and investments can be met without additional borrowing.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Net Worth:</strong> Net worth equals total assets minus total liabilities. For individuals, it represents financial health and stability. For businesses, it shows solvency and performance. Positive net worth means assets exceed debts. Tracking net worth over time helps measure financial progress and supports better decision-making.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Credit Score:</strong> A credit score is a number ranging from 300 to 850 that indicates a person’s creditworthiness. It's based on payment history, credit utilization, and account age. Higher scores mean lower lending risk, influencing loan approvals, interest rates, and financial trust from banks and creditors.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Interest Rate:</strong> The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money, usually expressed as a percentage. It determines how much extra you'll pay on loans or earn on savings. Rates vary based on credit risk, loan type, and economic conditions, and they influence investment and borrowing decisions.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Annual Percentage Rate (APR):</strong> APR represents the annual cost of borrowing, including interest and fees. It helps compare different loan offers. A lower APR means a cheaper loan over time. It's more accurate than just looking at interest rates alone, especially for credit cards, mortgages, and personal loans.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Annual Percentage Yield (APY):</strong> APY is the annual return on an investment or savings account, factoring in compound interest. It reflects the real rate of earnings over a year, making it useful for comparing deposit accounts. A higher APY means more interest earned, assuming no withdrawals occur.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Budget:</strong> A budget is a financial plan outlining expected income and expenses over a specific period. It helps manage spending, save money, and achieve goals. Budgets can be personal or business-focused and ensure financial discipline by tracking where money goes and controlling overspending habits.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Diversification:</strong> Diversification spreads investments across multiple assets to reduce risk. By not relying on a single investment, losses in one area may be offset by gains in another. It's a core strategy in portfolio management and protects against volatility in unpredictable financial markets.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Inflation:</strong> Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises over time, decreasing purchasing power. It impacts savings, wages, and investment returns. Central banks use monetary policy to control inflation and ensure stable economic growth and currency value.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Deflation:</strong> Deflation is the decline in prices for goods and services, often caused by reduced consumer demand. While it may seem positive, prolonged deflation can lead to lower wages, job losses, and economic slowdown. It signals a shrinking economy and can result in a recession if persistent.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Recession:</strong> A recession is a significant decline in economic activity lasting more than a few months. It's characterized by falling GDP, high unemployment, and reduced consumer spending. Governments respond with stimulus policies to revive growth. Recessions affect businesses, job markets, and investment confidence.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Risk Tolerance:</strong> Risk tolerance is the level of variability in investment returns an individual is willing to accept. It depends on age, income, goals, and personality. Understanding your risk tolerance helps choose suitable investments and avoid panic during market fluctuations. Higher tolerance allows for more aggressive investing.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Return on Investment (ROI):</strong> ROI measures the gain or loss generated on an investment relative to its cost. It’s expressed as a percentage and helps evaluate profitability. A higher ROI indicates more efficient use of capital. It’s widely used in comparing investment opportunities across business ventures and personal financial strategies.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Compound Interest:</strong> Compound interest is calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. It causes investments or debts to grow faster than simple interest. The more frequently interest is compounded, the greater the effect. It’s key to building long-term wealth through savings or investments.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Simple Interest:</strong> Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount. It does not take into account any accumulated interest. This method is commonly used in car loans and short-term borrowing. While predictable and easy to calculate, it yields lower returns compared to compound interest over time.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Capital Gains:</strong> Capital gains are the profits made from selling an asset for more than its purchase price. These can come from investments like stocks, real estate, or bonds. Capital gains are often subject to taxation and are categorized as short-term or long-term depending on the holding period.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Dividend:</strong> A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, typically in cash or additional stock. Dividends represent a portion of the company’s earnings and reward investors. Regular dividends can indicate strong financial health and are commonly found in mature, stable companies with consistent profits.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Expense Ratio:</strong> The expense ratio is the annual fee charged by mutual funds, ETFs, or other investment funds to cover operating costs. Expressed as a percentage of assets, it directly affects investor returns. Lower expense ratios are preferable as they leave more money in your investments over time.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Asset Allocation:</strong> Asset allocation is an investment strategy that divides a portfolio among different asset categories such as stocks, bonds, and cash. It aims to balance risk and reward based on an investor’s goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Proper asset allocation is key to long-term portfolio success.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Bull Market:</strong> A bull market refers to a financial market in which prices are rising or are expected to rise. It reflects investor confidence and optimism about the economy. Bull markets can occur across asset classes like stocks, real estate, or crypto, often driven by strong economic indicators.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Bear Market:</strong> A bear market is a period during which investment prices fall by 20% or more from recent highs. It signals investor pessimism and often coincides with economic downturns. Bear markets can affect investor behavior and trigger panic selling, though they also present opportunities for strategic long-term investing.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Liquidity:</strong> Liquidity refers to how quickly an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its price. Cash is the most liquid asset. High liquidity ensures flexibility in spending and investing, while illiquid assets may be harder to sell. Liquidity is critical for emergency preparedness and market stability.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):</strong> DTI is a personal finance measure comparing monthly debt payments to gross monthly income. It helps lenders assess a borrower’s ability to manage payments and repay debts. A lower DTI indicates better financial health and increases the chance of loan approval with favorable terms.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Credit Utilization:</strong> Credit utilization refers to the percentage of available credit being used. It plays a major role in credit scores. Keeping utilization under 30% is ideal for maintaining healthy credit. High usage can indicate over-reliance on credit and may negatively impact loan applications and interest rates.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Principal:</strong> The principal is the original sum of money borrowed or invested, excluding interest or earnings. In loans, it’s the amount you repay over time. In investments, it’s the initial capital. Understanding principal helps track how much is owed or how much has grown through returns or interest.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Amortization:</strong> Amortization refers to the gradual repayment of a loan over time through scheduled installments of principal and interest. It applies to mortgages and other long-term loans. Amortization schedules show how much of each payment goes to interest versus principal, helping borrowers manage repayment effectively.</li>
      <li><strong style="color:#34C759;">Depreciation:</strong> Depreciation is the reduction in the value of an asset over time due to wear and tear, aging, or obsolescence. It is an accounting method used to allocate the cost of tangible assets like vehicles or machinery. Depreciation impacts taxes, net income, and asset valuation on financial statements.</li>
