    <h2>Glossary (Page 2 of 3)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Financial Statement:</strong> A financial statement summarizes a company’s financial performance and position. The three main types are balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. These documents are essential for investors, regulators, and stakeholders to assess a company’s profitability, liquidity, and stability. Accurate financial statements aid decision-making and strategic planning.</li>
      <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> A balance sheet is a financial snapshot showing a company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. It follows the formula: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. This statement helps evaluate financial health, showing what the business owns, owes, and the owner’s stake in the company.</li>
      <li><strong>Income Statement:</strong> An income statement, also known as a profit and loss statement, shows a company’s revenues, expenses, and profits over a period. It helps determine financial performance by outlining net income or loss. Investors and managers use it to evaluate profitability, control costs, and inform strategic decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> The cash flow statement tracks how cash moves through a business, divided into operating, investing, and financing activities. It helps evaluate liquidity, ensuring the company can meet short-term obligations. Unlike profit-based reports, it focuses solely on real cash movement, providing clarity on financial operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Gross Income:</strong> Gross income is the total earnings before any deductions, including taxes and expenses. For individuals, it includes wages, bonuses, and interest. For businesses, it’s total revenue minus the cost of goods sold (COGS). Gross income indicates profitability potential and is a basis for calculating taxes and net income.</li>
      <li><strong>Net Income:</strong> Net income is the amount of money left after all expenses, taxes, and costs have been subtracted from total revenue. Also known as the bottom line, it reflects true profitability. Investors and businesses use net income to assess financial performance, make decisions, and determine dividend payments.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxable Income:</strong> Taxable income is the portion of income subject to taxes after deductions and exemptions. It includes wages, interest, dividends, and capital gains. Accurate calculation ensures compliance and avoids penalties. Understanding taxable income helps with tax planning, optimizing refunds, and making informed financial decisions for both individuals and businesses.</li>
      <li><strong>Capital:</strong> Capital refers to financial assets or funds used to fuel business operations and growth. It includes money, equipment, and property. In personal finance, it may refer to investment funds. Capital is crucial for starting businesses, expanding ventures, and investing in opportunities that generate income or increase wealth.</li>
      <li><strong>Working Capital:</strong> Working capital measures a company’s operational efficiency and short-term financial health. Calculated as current assets minus current liabilities, it reflects liquidity and the ability to meet immediate obligations. Positive working capital means the company can pay bills and invest, while negative working capital signals potential cash flow issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Assets Under Management (AUM):</strong> AUM refers to the total market value of assets that an investment company or financial advisor manages on behalf of clients. It reflects trust, scale, and influence. A growing AUM indicates business growth and better revenue potential, especially in wealth management and mutual fund companies.</li>
      <li><strong>Securities:</strong> Securities are tradable financial instruments that hold value. They include stocks, bonds, and derivatives. Investors buy securities to earn returns through dividends, interest, or price appreciation. They are regulated to ensure transparency and protect investors. Securities play a central role in capital markets and investment strategies.</li>
      <li><strong>Derivatives:</strong> Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from underlying assets like stocks, commodities, or currencies. Common types include futures, options, and swaps. Used for hedging risk or speculative purposes, derivatives help manage uncertainty. They can be complex and carry high risk but offer strategic financial tools for investors.</li>
      <li><strong>Options:</strong> Options are financial contracts giving the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price within a set timeframe. They are used for hedging, income, or speculation. Options add flexibility and leverage to investment strategies but involve risk and require informed usage.</li>
      <li><strong>Futures:</strong> Futures are standardized contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific date. Traded on exchanges, futures are used for hedging or speculating on price movements in commodities, currencies, and financial instruments. They involve leverage and carry risk, making them suitable for experienced investors.</li>
      <li><strong>ETF (Exchange Traded Fund):</strong> ETFs are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, similar to stocks. They hold assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities and offer diversification, low fees, and liquidity. ETFs are popular among individual investors for building diversified portfolios with ease and tracking indexes like the S&P 500.</li>
